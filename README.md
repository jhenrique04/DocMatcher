# DocMatcher

## Overview - WIP

This project is focused on analyzing documents related to cybersecurity risks and comparing them against a dataset of expert-reviewed documents, considered as the standard for each document type. The primary objective is to provide feedback on the analyzed documents based on the established expert-reviewed standards.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `pdf_reader/`: Contains the code for PDF text extraction.
- `preprocessor/`: Includes preprocessing functions for document analysis.
- `bert_model/`: Contains the fine-tuned BERT model for text embeddings.
- `analyzer/`: Code for document analysis and feedback generation.
- `word2vec_models/`: Word2Vec models for word embeddings.
- `train/`: Store your training documents.
- `test/`: Store the documents you want to analyze and generate feedback for.

The last two directories could not be uploaded on Github for copyright reasons.

## The project is still under development, feel free to contribute.
